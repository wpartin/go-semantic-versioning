# go-semantic-versioning
Version packages with the Semantic Versioning standard, and Go.

# Install
Clone the repository, and then cd into the /cmd directory. Type "go install go-semantic-versioning". You can now use the package with: "go-semantic-versioning --branch {branch}". Supported branches are release, feature, hotfix, and bugfix. 

# Philosophy
The idea behind this project is to have a clean, trunk-based repository for your application, while being able to version specific points easily. You can plug this tool into your CI/CD pipeline, and based upon the branch prefix merging into main/master, create an incremented version in your Git history.

# Example
Create feature/* branch off of master -> make code changes -> create a Pull Request for review -> merge kicks off a CI/CD tool that you use -> that tool runs this one as a step -> the tool creates your tag and applies it to that point of the repository
